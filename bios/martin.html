									<h1>Lewis Hypolite Martin</h1>
									<p>Died 1918</p>

								<p>Lewis Hypolite Martin was born in Breaux Bridge, Louisiana, in approximately 1888. Lewis attended private schools in Crowley, Louisiana, and afterwards attended St. Mary’s College in St. Mary, Kentucky. On September 20, 1906, Martin enrolled in Louisiana State University and graduated in 1911 with a Bachelor of Arts degree; he later returned to earn degrees in agriculture and animal husbandry. After graduation he moved back to his father’s farm. </p>
								<p>Martin enrolled in the Agricultural Department of Cornell University. Upon graduation, he was named Demonstration Agent for Assumption Parish, where he worked for three years. Martin was known for his exceptional skills in agriculture. As stated in The Donaldsonville Chief (October 26, 1918): “he showed marked ability as an organizer and as a practical guide in diversified agriculture and livestock progress.” After the war began, Martin was involved in working to increase food production. This was a huge responsibility for Martin as shown in this item he wrote for a New Orleans newspaper: </p>
								<blockquote> “The United States has given a hint to the southern people that they must feed themselves. Our soldier boys are doing their bit ‘over there’, and it is up to us to do our bit ‘over here.’ Our soldiers must be fed, our Allies must be fed. THE SOUTH HAS ALWAYS DEPENDED ON THE NORTH FOR FOOD AND FEED CROPS. As a patriotic duty, we should feed ourselves. The city people can help by producing something to eat in the home garden.”</blockquote>
										   <p>-Lewis H. Martin, “South Must Feed Self, Says U.S. Agent, Urging More Home Gardens”
															<br />[New Orleans Item- Tribune March 8, 1918]</p>
								
								<p>Martin contributed to funds to purchase Delia plantation, comprised of 1,700 acres, in Assumption Parish. The land was used for agricultural experimentation to grow healthier pest-resistant crops. Martin soon moved to New Orleans where he became an Emergency Demonstration Agent for the Parish of Orleans. There he worked to destroy insect pests in home gardens throughout the parish. He was also the first person to introduce the lady bug from California to New Orleans in an effort to destroy insect pests while not harming the environment. </p>
								<p>In August 1918, Martin joined the United States Naval Reserve Forces. The armed forces advised Martin to keep his job as a Demonstration Agent until he was called to battle. But in the meantime he contracted the Spanish influenza and pneumonia. Martin finally received orders from the naval authorities that he should proceed to the Naval Reserve Training Camp in Seattle, Washington, one day before he died on October 19, 2018. </p>
