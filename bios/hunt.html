								<p>Leslie Carl Hunt was born on June 17th, 1896 in Tucker, Louisiana, and grew up on his father’s farm. Hunt enrolled at LSU in 1914, majoring in electrical engineering. He travelled to Fort Logan H. Roots, a training camp in Arkansas with intention to enlist, but he was rejected because he was underweight. Disappointed but not defeated, Hunt began following a strict bulking diet and worked on his physique. He tried again with Navy, Air Force, and Ship Drafting Service but all turned him away due to his weight. Finally he was admitted to the Student Army Training Corps at LSU where he was made an instructor. He became a Corporal of Company “A” for the 1915-1916 school year. Company “A” was the first line of the battalion and was known for its leadership in every activity of college life at the “Ole War Skule.” He quickly climbed ranks, becoming Sergeant of Company “A” the following school year. </p>

								<p>The 1916-1917 Company “A” was considered an example to all others in matters of military and general efficiency. He graduated in June 1918 with a Bachelor of Science degree from the College of Engineering. He maintained his status on the Honor Roll all four years of college. His senior quote reads, “Of manners gentle, of affections mild.” The same year, the Spanish Influenza broke out and became a global epidemic. Hunt contracted influenza in October of 1918. He died later that month on October 20th. His mother described his last day to be just like the rest of his life— “without fear or complaint.” </p>

								<p>He was buried in his hometown of Tucker, Louisiana. Sadly, Hunt did not live long enough to see Germany surrender on November 11, 1918. Leslie Carl Hunt’s devotion to his country should be an inspiration to all citizens.  His academic career remains an example to students as he committed himself to his studies with passion and enthusiasm. </p>
