								<p>Lawrence E. Brogan was born January 18, 1895, in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Brogan played on the football team while enrolled at LSU. Years later while working in the lumber industry, Brogan enlisted in the U.S. Army and attended training camp at Leon Springs, Texas; he achieved the rank of First Lieutenant, Field Artillery. He was transferred to Waco, Texas, where he served as an instructor in the Ground Flyers Section. In the spring of 1918, he was moved to Camp Jackson, South Carolina, to train in field artillery awaiting deployment to the front. In June of 1918 he went to Camp Dix, New Jersey, and then on to Toul, France. </p>

								<p>In October of 1918, Broganâ€™s division, the 349th field artillery, were stationed on the front lines of the trenches. Brogan served as a Regimental Gas Officer. During 1918 and 1919, a deadly strain of pneumonia ravaged soldiers at the front. In November of 1918 Brogan was struck by a severe case of pneumonia, and on the 14th he passed away. He was buried in Toul, France. </p>
