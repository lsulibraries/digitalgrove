								<p>David Jenkins Ewing, Jr. was born on July 12, 1892 in New Orleans to Mr. and Mrs. David Ewing.  Ewing’s mother died when he was a child and he and his younger sisters were raised by their father and two aunts.  Ewing enrolled at LSU in September of 1907 but left school shortly afterward.  He reentered LSU in 1910 as a sophomore and belonged to the Lambda Chi Alpha social fraternity, Sigma Delta Chi professional journalism fraternity, the Commercial Club, and the New Orleans Club.  Ewing was elected junior class president in 1911 and was a special assignment reporter for The Reveille, and the following year became editor in chief.  He graduated with honors with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1912.  After graduation, Ewing went to work for the New Orleans Times-Democrat where he covered the federal building and the courts.  In 1915, he transferred to their Baton Rouge office as a special correspondent and enrolled in the LSU Law School, receiving his L.L.B. in 1915.  By 1917, Ewing joined the U.S. Army and entered the First Officers’ Training Camp at Fort Logan H. Roots, Arkansas.  He was later assigned to Camp Pike, Arkansas, and he became a lieutenant.  He was transferred to the Seventh U.S. Infantry and shipped off to France in April, 1918.  Ewing was killed in action on July 27, 1918 during the Aisne-Marne offensive. </p>
