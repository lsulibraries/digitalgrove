								<p>Alan Louis Labbé was born on June 19, 1890 in St. Martinville, Louisiana to Mr. and Mrs. T.J. Labbé.  He entered LSU as a special student in September of 1907 and took up electrical engineering the following year.  Labbé passed the entrance examinations to the United States Naval Academy and was admitted in July 1909.  In 1911, he resigned from the naval academy and entered the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.  While there, he became a member of Tau Delta Tau fraternity and was a member of the Knights of Columbus and the Elks.  Labbé returned to Louisiana and became the principal of Jeanerette High School and in 1916, married the former Ellen Simon.  They had one daughter.  Labbé was exempted from the draft but by the summer of 1918, he joined the navy and became an ensign.  He was in the Officers Material Class where he contracted typhoid fever and died on September 30, 1918 after an illness of four weeks.  He is buried in St. Martinville.    </p>
