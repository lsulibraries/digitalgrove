								<p>Charles Nichols Singletary was born on June 18, 1888 in Sugartown, Louisiana, to Archibald Calhoun Singletary and Elizabeth Minnie Singletary.  Singletary attended the Louisiana Industrial Institute (now Louisiana Tech) and entered LSU in 1914 as a freshman in the Agricultural Course.  As a student, he led Bible study classes and was a member of the YMCA.  In September 1917, Singletary left LSU for the United States Army and went to Camp Pike, Arkansas, and later transferred to Camp Beauregard, Louisiana.  He remained there until May of 1918 when he was sent to France.  He belonged to Company A, and later Company C, of the 9th Infantry and was assigned to the signals school before being sent to the front.  Singletary saw combat in the battles of Champagne and St. Mihiel, and died on October 4, 1918 of wounds received in action.  He is buried at Marne Hospital Cemetery in Suippes, France.
