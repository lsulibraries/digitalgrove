								<p>Hall was born in Jennings, Louisiana, on June 25, 1889. He graduated from Jennings High School in 1908. Hall was a member of the LSU football team, the LSU riflery team and Kappa Sigma fraternity. He graduated from LSU in 1913, and moved to Puerto Rico in 1914 to serve as an elementary school teacher and perform work for the Department of Revenue. He was the first to enlist in Jennings, Louisiana, in 1917, and attended training camp in Fort Logan H. Roots, Arkansas. Hall earned the rank of First Lieutenant, and was assigned to Company K of the 345th Infantry at Fort Pike, Arkansas. After his promotion to Captain of Company E, Hall transferred to Fort Meade, Maryland, where he served as a training officer for the 71st Infantry Regiment. He died from influenza on October 7, 1918. The American Legion Post 19 in Jennings, Louisiana, is named for him. </p>
