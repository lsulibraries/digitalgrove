								<p>Ike Hahn Gottlieb was born to Joseph Gottlieb and Rebecca Hahn Gottlieb in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, on June 6, 1892. He graduated high school in 1907. He initially enrolled at LSU as a civil engineering major, but later changed his focus to agriculture. He studied at the Audubon Sugar Institute in Baton Rouge and Audubon Park in New Orleans. Gottlieb was a member of the Pi chapter of Jewish fraternity Zeta Beta Tau, along with his brother, Lewis. He was a member of the football and track teams, served on the editorial board of the Gumbo, and was a member of the Alpha Chi Sigma honorary chemical fraternity. He graduated from LSU in 1913, and began working as a sugar chemist first in Reserve, Louisiana, and then for a year in Puerto Rico. He worked for a short time at the McCall Planting Company, then became the manager of the Capital City Auto Company of Baton Rouge. Gottlieb entered the U.S. Navy as an engineer on June 3, 1918. He served as a Chief Machinist’s Mate in the U.S. Naval Reserve Force. He died of pneumonia at the St. Vincent’s Naval Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, in October 13, 1918. </p>
