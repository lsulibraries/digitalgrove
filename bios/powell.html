								<p>Thomas James Powell, Jr. was born on August 10, 1883 in Lake Providence, Louisiana.  He was a student at LSU from 1901 to 1903.  After leaving LSU, Powell entered the United States Army and spent two years in The Philippines.  In 1910, Powell left the army and went into the lumber business.  He married the former Bessie Blackburn of Lake Providence in 1912 and they had three children.  When war was declared in 1917, although considered over age for military service, Powell believed it was his duty as an experienced soldier to reenlist.  He entered the Second Officers Training Camp at Camp Travis, Texas and became a first lieutenant serving as an instructor of bayonet tactics until June, 1917.  In the St. Mihiel offensive, Powell became commander of Company I, 358th Infantry and was killed on September 12, 1918.  He is buried in France.</p>
