									<h1>Leslie Philip Backes</h1>
									<p>1897 - 1918</p>
								</header>

								<p>Leslie Philip Backes was born on May 3, 1897, in New Orleans, Louisiana, to Victor J. A. Backes of New Orleans and M. Barbara Buchel of Baton Rouge. In 1906 Backes and his family, along with his older sister Muriel Joyce Backes, moved to Baton Rouge. He graduated from high school in 1916. Throughout his primary years, Backes was a Boy Scout, and he remained involved during college. While at LSU he was in the College of Agriculture, a private in the D Company, led by Captain Winfred Charles Green, and made the Honor Roll. </p>

								<p>During his sophomore year at LSU, Backes volunteered in New Orleans at the recruiting center of the U.S. Marine Corps on June 13, 1918, and was sent to Paris Island, South Carolina, on June 19. Shortly afterwards he received the Boy Scout Scoutmasterâ€™s certificate for Troop No. 5 of Baton Rouge on June 22, 1918. He was sworn into the military on June 24 in the 192nd Company and entered the school for non-commissioned officers, Company R, on August 12. Backes was appointed Corporal and Squad Leader in the 393rd Drill Company by Major C.A. Capron of the U.S. Marine Corps of Port Royal, South Carolina on September 19, 1918. He was transferred from Paris Island, South Carolina, to Quantico, Virginia, on November 4, 1918. While in Quantico he was sent to the hospital on November 4 and then died of pneumonia, influenza, and bronchitis on November 19, 1918. He was only 21 years old, one of the thousands who succumbed to the epidemic. </p>

								<p>A commemorative service was held for Backes and the other 30 LSU students who died during the war on January 2, 1920, which was coincidentally the 60th Anniversary of the founding of LSU. The service was held at Garig Hall at 8 AM, Reverend Royal K. Tucker gave the invocation. His father had a marble bench installed in the vestibule of the Presbyterian Church in Baton Rouge to serve as a memorial to his work with the Boy Scouts. </p>
