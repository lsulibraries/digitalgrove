								<p>William Digby Morgan was born on a farm to Louis and Lula Morgan on October 5, 1886, in Tangipahoa Parish. On September 16, 1902, at the young age of 15, William enrolled at Louisiana State University and began the Sugar course. During the years of 1903-1904, he joined the band, and was a member of the St. Louis Battalion, the vice president of the Jefferson Davis Literary Society and class representative of the “Gumbo” Board. From 1905-1906, William was the sergeant of Company C and joined the Pi Kappa Alpha fraternity. During his last year, 1906-1907, he was the editor of “Gumbo,” the president of the Pipe and Mug Club, the president of the fencing club, a member of the Grady Burke Literary Society, and a member of the Retired Officers’ Club. His senior quote, “He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit,” is taken from Shakespeare’s comedic play “Much Ado About Nothing.” Morgan graduated with the degree of Bachelor of Science in 1907 at the age of 20. </p>

								<p>Morgan was working as a sugar chemist in Cuba when the U.S. joined World War I. He 
								enlisted in the Officers’ Training School at Fort Logan H. Roots, Arkansas, and later left for France as Lieutenant of Company E, 128th Infantry, 32nd Division, American Expeditionary
								Forces. He was offered a staff position once he arrived in France, he declined because he preferred active duty. He led his company in the Battle of Argonne which took place from September 26, 1918 - November 11, 1918. For ten days Morgan and his men fought without re-enforcements. On the day of his death, his company had progressed significantly and were exposed to heavy fire from machine guns. He was soon shot through the heart by a sniper and died instantly in the arms of Lieutenant I. B. Broussard from Crowley, Louisiana. His death was avenged by a fellow soldier from Tangipahoa, Lee Hilbert, who saw the sniper and killed him. William Digby Morgan died heroically at the age of 32 on November 10th, 1918, one day before the war ended. He is buried in Romagne, France, at the Meuse-Argonne American Cemetery. </p>
