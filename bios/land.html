								<p>David Thompson Land, Jr., was born on September 16, 1891 in Shreveport to Mr. and Mrs. David T. Land.  He entered LSU on September 21, 1910 and graduated with a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering in 1915.  After graduating, Land went to work for the Colonial Sugar Co. in Gramercy, Louisiana.  He married the former Mattie Gray Morris of Shreveport on August 14, 1917.  On August 24, 1917, Land volunteered for the U.S. Army and entered the Second Officersâ€™ Training Camp at Leon Springs, Texas.  He was later sent to Fort Winfield Scott near San Francisco where he was commissioned a first lieutenant in the Coast Artillery Corps.  Land was sent next to the Presidio at Monterrey, California and in August 1918, was transferred to Camp Mills, New York where he would sail for France on August 31.  Land died of influenza shortly after his arrival in France.  His daughter would be born a few days after his death. </p>
